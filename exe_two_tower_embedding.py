In a recommendation system, a common approach is to use matrix factorization techniques like collaborative filtering. In a two-tower model, you typically have two separate embedding layers for users and items (movies in this case). To create a loss function based on the dot product of customer and movie embeddings, you can follow these steps:

Embedding Layers: First, you need to define the embedding layers for both users and movies. These layers will map each user and movie to a dense vector space.

Dot Product: Calculate the dot product between the user embeddings and movie embeddings. This will give you a measure of how similar the user's preferences are to the characteristics of the movie.

Loss Function: Define a suitable loss function to optimize. Common choices include Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.

Training: Train the model using backpropagation to minimize the loss function.
